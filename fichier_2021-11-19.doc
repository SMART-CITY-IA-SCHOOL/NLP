  In view of the density of our district, would we not be legitimate to ask the municipality for stricter regulation of the use of leaf wind tunnels (less noisy and hourly appliances). I think it is a huge nuisance. What do you think? A collective approach would perhaps be fruitful...

A unique concept in Morges... on the other hand, to collect taxes they know how to assume their responsibilities. Some ities have banned these atmospheric devices in favor of the electric.

  I do not see any mention of the prohibition of this type of device in favour of the electric. An interpellation of the municipality could make sense and free us from this noise pollution.

  Old ramp/new access ramp -14: Hello,  announces that while waiting for the direct opening of the access to the car park scheduled for the , a new ramp is open. Unfortunately they announce the removal of the metal ramp on the staircase near the . However, this ramp offers the possibility of going by bike, scooter, trolley,.. on the gottaz side, the Burtigniere school and I regret that it has been abolished. We are told that it is slippery, but the new smooth wooden will be even more so as soon as it rains. In addition, it has a right angle not easy to negotiate and the lower edge deserves to be planed or put a small metal junction to allow the passage of the trolley wheels (photo). I would like the metal ramp on side /12 to become a real concrete ramp, less slippery than wood or metal, to allow an alternative for those who do not go through the parking lot and go to the west side. Thank you Hello,  announces a new ramp and the removal of the old metal.

  I agree with you. Moving by bike, it is impossible to circulate on a narrow, winding path and with an angle.?????  I also want the metal ramp to remain.

  In view of the density of our district, would we not be legitimate to ask the municipality for stricter regulation of the use of leaf wind tunnels (less noisy and hourly appliances). I think it is a huge nuisance. What do you think? A collective approach would perhaps be fruitful...

  I do not see any mention of the prohibition of this type of device in favour of the electric. An interpellation of the municipality could make sense and free us from this noise pollution.

Unfortunately they announce the removal of the metal ramp on the staircase near the . However, this ramp offers the possibility of going by bike, scooter, trolley,.. on the gottaz side, the Burtigniere school and I regret that it has been abolished. We are told that it is slippery, but the new smooth wooden will be even more so as soon as it rains. In addition, it has a right angle not easy to negotiate and the lower edge deserves to be planed or put a small metal junction to allow the passage of the trolley wheels (photo). I would like the metal ramp on side /12 to become a real concrete ramp, less slippery than wood or metal, to allow an alternative for those who do not go through the parking lot and go to the west side.

  In view of the density of our district, would we not be legitimate to ask the municipality for stricter regulation of the use of leaf wind tunnels (less noisy and hourly appliances). I think it is a huge nuisance. What do you think? A collective approach would perhaps be fruitful...

Unfortunately they announce the removal of the metal ramp on the staircase near the . However, this ramp offers the possibility of going by bike, scooter, trolley,.. on the gottaz side, the Burtigniere school and I regret that it has been abolished. We are told that it is slippery, but the new smooth wooden will be even more so as soon as it rains. In addition, it has a right angle not easy to negotiate and the lower edge deserves to be planed or put a small metal junction to allow the passage of the trolley wheels (photo). I would like the metal ramp on side /12 to become a real concrete ramp, less slippery than wood or metal, to allow an alternative for those who do not go through the parking lot and go to the west side. Thank you Hello,  announces a new ramp and the removal of the old metal.

  In view of the density of our district, would we not be legitimate to ask the municipality for stricter regulation of the use of leaf wind tunnels (less noisy and hourly appliances). I think it is a huge nuisance. What do you think? A collective approach would perhaps be fruitful...

  In view of the density of our district, would we not be legitimate to ask the municipality for stricter regulation of the use of leaf wind tunnels (less noisy and hourly appliances). I think it is a huge nuisance. What do you think? A collective approach would perhaps be fruitful...

  In view of the density of our district, would we not be legitimate to ask the municipality for stricter regulation of the use of leaf wind tunnels (less noisy and hourly appliances). I think it is a huge nuisance. What do you think? A collective approach would perhaps be fruitful...

  I do not see any mention of the prohibition of this type of device in favour of the electric. An interpellation of the municipality could make sense and free us from this noise pollution.

  Old ramp/new access ramp -14: Hello,  announces that while waiting for the direct opening of the access to the car park scheduled for the , a new ramp is open. Unfortunately they announce the removal of the metal ramp on the staircase near the . However, this ramp offers the possibility of going by bike, scooter, trolley,.. on the gottaz side, the Burtigniere school and I regret that it has been abolished. We are told that it is slippery, but the new smooth wooden will be even more so as soon as it rains. In addition, it has a right angle not easy to negotiate and the lower edge deserves to be planed or put a small metal junction to allow the passage of the trolley wheels (photo). I would like the metal ramp on side /12 to become a real concrete ramp, less slippery than wood or metal, to allow an alternative for those who do not go through the parking lot and go to the west side. Thank you Hello,  announces a new ramp and the removal of the old metal.

  I agree with you. Moving by bike, it is impossible to circulate on a narrow, winding path and with an angle.?????  I also want the metal ramp to remain.

  In view of the density of our district, would we not be legitimate to ask the municipality for stricter regulation of the use of leaf wind tunnels (less noisy and hourly appliances). I think it is a huge nuisance. What do you think? A collective approach would perhaps be fruitful...

  Hello Here is the response of the ity following my interpellation. "Hello, We acknowledge receipt of your email and thank you for it. In order to best meet your request, could you tell me if it is the  of the building or a  ? If it is the  of the building, you can contact the management of the building directly. In advance, we thank you and ask you to receive our cordial greetings" I did not know that the  were responsible for enforcing the police regulations. A unique concept in Morges... on the other hand, to collect taxes they know how to assume their responsibilities. Some ities have banned these atmospheric devices in favor of the electric. It does not seem to me that this is the case in Morges.

  I do not see any mention of the prohibition of this type of device in favour of the electric. An interpellation of the municipality could make sense and free us from this noise pollution.

  Old ramp/new access ramp -14: Hello,  announces that while waiting for the direct opening of the access to the car park scheduled for the , a new ramp is open. Unfortunately they announce the removal of the metal ramp on the staircase near the . However, this ramp offers the possibility of going by bike, scooter, trolley,.. on the gottaz side, the Burtigniere school and I regret that it has been abolished. We are told that it is slippery, but the new smooth wooden will be even more so as soon as it rains. In addition, it has a right angle not easy to negotiate and the lower edge deserves to be planed or put a small metal junction to allow the passage of the trolley wheels (photo). I would like the metal ramp on side /12 to become a real concrete ramp, less slippery than wood or metal, to allow an alternative for those who do not go through the parking lot and go to the west side. Thank you Hello,  announces a new ramp and the removal of the old metal.

  I agree with you. Moving by bike, it is impossible to circulate on a narrow, winding path and with an angle.?????  I also want the metal ramp to remain.
